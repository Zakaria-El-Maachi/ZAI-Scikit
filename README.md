# Z-MachineLearningLibrary
My Personal Machine Learning Library

This is a personal Machine Learning library that I would like to build in order to further my understanding of the algorithms and implement them from scratch with the help of numpy, no more.

Thus, optimization is not a concern to me, nor is documentation or code readability. Having said that, I will try to devote some effort to it !

<h5 style="color:green"> All Models' features need to be 2D Arrays even if there is one feature </h3>
<ul>
<li> No documnetation
<li> Better OOP Design and Redundancy Omitting
<li> To be implemented :
    <ul>
        <li> Gaussian Naive Bayes
        <li> Logistic Regression
        <li> Support Vector Machine
        <li> Gradient Boosting
        <li> DBSCAN and HDBSCAN
        <li> K-Means
        <li> PCA - UMAP
        <li> Reinforcement Learning
        <li> AlphaZero
        <li> Factorization Methods
        <li> Convolutional Neural Networks
        <li> RNN + LSTM
        <li> Transformers
    </ul>
<li> Needs Better Implementations :
    <ul>
        <li> Faster BallTree / KDTree Algorithms for KNN
    </ul>
</ul>
